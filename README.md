# PID-Based Wheel Velocity Control for Autonomous Mobile Robots

## About
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for simulating and controlling the wheel velocities of a mobile robot using PID controllers. The simulation includes actuator dynamics, encoder feedback, and wheel kinematics to test and tune the controller in real-time. The code can also be adapted for deployment on physical robots.

## Features
- Velocity-form PID control for left and right wheels.
- Real-time simulation with sensor and actuator updates.
- Data logging for wheel velocities and controller performance.
- Plotting and visualization of setpoints vs actual wheel velocities.
